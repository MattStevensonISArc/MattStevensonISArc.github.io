                        For as long as I can remember I have been enthralled by technology and the aspects, possibilities and limitations surrounding it as a mode of study.
                        I am an active gamer and to this day continue to pursue my interest recreationally playing and studying games and game engines, whilst keeping up to date with current releases and technological advances.

                            I feel skateboarding is a very challenging sport and one that requires fair volumes of both motivation and determination in order to
                            excel and become a more talented skateboarder.

                                when designing or creating a piece of work. I feel I have a good eye for aesthetic appeal, something that is definitively a requirement in FMM as well as a fine-tuned mind with a creative spark.

                    <h4><small><i>During my time at Belfast High, I really developed an interest in all things computer related - I decided GCSE's based on my academic profile, adjudged by subjects I was passionate about
                        and those that I excelled in. When I entered my penultimate years of attending school and thoughts of University lingered ever present, I understood the path I wished to follow.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Achieving lowly in my last year of school in Technology and Design I realised I would have to commit entirely to raising my grade and passing the qualification. My attempts to repair my low accomplishments were directly influenced by my ability to perform well in creative areas of the subject criteria, coursework.
                        I achieved top of my class in designing, illustrating, manufacturing and testing a product which was intended to serve the needs and requirements of a fictitious end user or organisation. The task was difficult and included sections of the course I wasn't as capable in such as use of arithmetic for electronic and microelectronic systems, but ever still I tried and was
                        determined to reach my goal and maintain a grade above a fail, to get to University and pursue a career.

                        <hr>

                        During my career at school I was only introduced to that of Microsoft FrontPage, where we were tasked with creating a website for a fictitious company and designing its aesthetics, linking its mainframe buttons and navigation system and creating a real, believable website suitable for the proposed company.
                        Here I did not demonstrate large quantities of knowledge in the hard-coding side of the web development, but I began to grasp it's core mechanics and get a feel for how websites and their infrastructures were developed. I used Adobe Photo Shop quite a but and my teacher was very impressed with how the website I had created looked in
                        relevance to other students, who had not created custom images for buttons and sliding carousels. I achieved a high grade for putting so much effort into my project and had been personally spoken to by my ICT teacher to commend me for such perfectionism, something I proudly uphold in the present with any piece of work I am passionate about.

                        I feel I am a committed and hard working student with an academic profile fitting that of the scholarship conditional criteria, having supported this with distinctive grades and achievements
                        relevant to that of the job description spanning a range of creative and artistic subjects. I feel the position is very suiting to the type of student I am and the skills I possess, being a very creative, analytical and meticulous thinker.
                        <hr>
                        I am very interested in the web development industry and can't stress enough my passion to hone my skills and further develop and broaden the range of knowledge I have in this specific discipline.
                        My knowledge of coding html, design of web pages and applications can only increase and achieve a higher degree of professionalism along with each design I create becoming more fine-tuned and to a higher degree of sophistication.
