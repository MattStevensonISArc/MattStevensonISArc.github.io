                        <h4>My name is Matt Stevenson, I'm twenty years old and I'm a third year student at the Ulster University, Coleraine.
                            Currently, I'm out of Uni and on a one year placement - where I work and study in 'ISArc',
                            a Software Development company who have taken on three voluntary placement students, including myself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This Website has been created with regards to a Level 3 Certificate in Web Design and Development (RQF), that I wish to obtain whilst here at ISArc.
                            During the course of a 6-8 week period, I will further develop this site to be a Log Entry site that can not only allow me to post up-to-date logs to my learning
                            but allow them to be viewed collectively, be edited and for Feedback to be sent me via email.

                <br>
                <div class="scroll"><h6>Today is Thursday the 8th of September, thus far the other placement students and I have been imaging our MacBook Pro’s, downloading and installing programs relating to
                    the work we will be doing over the course of the year.

                    Today, Alan has tasked us with ‘HTML & CSS 1’, which asks us to “Make a webpage in a folder on your desktop using a text editor”. To begin with I have installed ‘PhpStorm’,
                    a commercial IDE for HTML, PHP and JavaScript. Using PhpStorm I created a New Project with a blank .html file called ‘index’, giving the document a ‘document type’ of ‘html’,
                    this informs the browser used to load the page what type of file is being loaded. I then added a structure to the document, using ‘html’, ‘head’ and ‘body’ tags, these tags allow
                    for a basic page layout and form the building blocks required to create the rest of the webpage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From here I reverted back to my guidelines in which I’m asked to add several elements to the webpage, one of which was to include my name as a ‘header’. A header in html
                    is an element that offers a selection of text sizes to chose from, I used the ‘h1’ header tag although there are header tags h1 through to h6, h1 being the largest and h6
                    being the smallest. For my introductory paragraph I used ‘p’ tags to create the paragraph, the paragraph element differs from that of the header elements as it is used when
                    writing main body text that can be orientated by style sheets within the webpage, I set this element to ‘fixed-width’, so that it does not change no matter the size of the users
                    display. For the creation of a table within the webpage we have used ‘table’ tags with ‘tr’ tags for table rows, ‘th’ tags for table headings and ‘td’ for table data/contents,
                    I set this element to ‘fluid’, which allows the table to resize itself depending on the size of the users display. Creating a hyperlink for ‘W3 Schools’ was rather simple in that
                    using an ‘anchor’ tag ‘a’ and referencing a desired URL within quotations creates the hyperlink, then any text included will redirect the user to the destination upon clicking it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of CSS, I included a set of ‘style’ tags in the ‘head’ section of my HTML document, within these tags I have edited the webpage’s paragraph text using ‘font-family’ -
                    set to Arial and ‘font-size’ to ‘22px’, ‘padding-left’ set to ‘50px’ which pads the paragraph text 50 pixels from the left margin of the page, I also set ‘colour’ to white. For
                    headings ‘h2’ and ‘h3’ I set font to Arial and padding-left to ’10px’ and ‘20px’ respectively, with colour set to ‘ghostwhite’, for the ‘body’ of the document I set ‘background-colour’
                    to ‘grey’ - these colour names are preloaded into HTML and CSS and I did not use a Hexadecimal colour code to set them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I used ‘Quicktime Player’ to create a new voice recording and record myself speaking aloud “Welcome to my Placement Log”. By default the file was saved as a ‘.m4a’ audio file,
                    something we weren't interested in as the assessment criteria asks that we include both a ‘.mp3’ file and a ‘.ogg’ file, having taken this into consideration I converted the file
                    to the appropriate file formats using a online converter and saved them to my Projects folder. To create the audio player I used ‘audio’ tags, using the ‘controls’ attribute to add
                    audio controls such as play and pause, embedded in the audio tags I referenced each audio file with sources ‘src’ and assigning them a ‘type’ of ‘/ogg’ and ‘/mpeg’ respectively.
                    To view my webpage in a browser format I’m using ‘localhost’, an HTML 5 API.

                <br>
                <h6>Having completed HTML & CSS 1 with reasonable ease, we moved on to HTML & CSS 2. In this section I concentrated a lot more on the CSS of the webpage,
                    the first task was to apply a font change in CSS to an HTML element, I did this by firstly linking my style sheet to the html document in the ‘head’ section then using
                    ‘font-family’ and ‘font-size’ and set them to ‘Arial’ and ‘20px’ respectively. I then emboldened some text in this paragraph using ‘b’ tags, I added a background colour
                    to some of the text using ‘background-colour’ in CSS set to ‘yellow’, as well as a rounded border to a title in CSS setting it to ‘3px’, its style to ‘solid’ and the colour
                    to ‘red’, and finally setting ‘border-radius’ to ‘10px’ to create the rounded corners. Next up I created a ‘hover’ property and a transition effect on an image to make it
                    scale up to 110% of its original size. We we’re asked to create a transition effect of rotate and rotate Y, which we did originally but I removed this feature as it isn’t a
                    very appropriate transition for my webpage. We also created an overlay of position absolute and an unordered list with ‘li’ elements embedded within it with ‘button’ tags to
                    create a list of buttons.

                <h6>In this exercise we experimented with a GUI and uploaded changes made within the GUI to a web server, we used BlueGriffon. Firstly, I entered a header to the page and changed
                    the font to Arial and the size to 24, I then added another table to the page with no contents. We uploaded our edits to the W3 schools validator to validate our projects and check for errors and discrepancies in the code. Finally we uploaded out altered webpage to Git Hub, using the command line to add, commit and push the new page to our Git repositories.

                    Today we studied a multitude of topics relating to ‘Internet Architecture’, Internet Architecture is a term defining a vast number of networks interconnecting and
                    communicating with a common protocol. So what is a Client Server Network? A Client Server Network is a centralised network connected to a high performance machine,
                    called a ‘server’, the CSN acts as a ‘hub’ or focal point for other smaller and less powerful machines or nodes. A Client has certain requirements before it can operate,
                    one main essential is that it has a computer or other device to connect to, this device must contain a network card or be capable of connecting to a modem. A router is also
                    required for Client connectivity, many modern routers have a modem built into them, a browser is also a necessity.<br>
                    <br>

                    Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is a systematic telephone exchange which operates on an international scale, it transmits analogue voice data and signals using copper wires.

                    Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of standards for communication and transmission of data such as audio and video, ISDN operates on top of the PSDN.

                    Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is in referral to a ‘modem’ something very common in most homes of the modern age, a DSL modem can be connected to a router and a broadband telephone
                    line in order to allow a computer or other device to access Internet services.

                    Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol which allows for both sending and receiving data packets over the Internet, the protocol defines a format for data sent and received along with
                    deciding upon a method by which data is to be sent.

                    Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a conceptual model with 7 main layers, it characterises how applications can communicate over a network, allowing software programs
                    to operate together.

                    Point-of-Protocol (PPP) is a protocol which establishes a direct link between two machines, often simply one node connected to a server.

                    Ajax (JavaScript) is a script that allows communication between the client and a server without the need for a complete refresh of the page.
                    Point of Presence (POP) is an access point or interface point in which multiple networks connect to each other, often referring to a location or facility that allows nodes to connect
                    to the Internet.<br>
                    <br>

                    Internet eXchange Point (IXP) is a network infrastructure that allows ISP’s to exchange internet traffic, there are a very limited amount of them in the world.

                    Domain Name Systems (DNS) is a naming system for computers or other devices with Internet connectivity, it looks up addresses using a naming structure of a prefix, subdomain, domain
                    name and an extension. ‘.com’ and the likes are top level domain names, ‘.co.uk' is a second level domain name.

                    Shared Domains are alterations of the subdomains part of an address, allowing separate parts of a server to be accessed using domain registrars e.g. https://finance.nowthis.tech.

                    Cloud Computing is a form of storing and processing data over the Internet without the use of a local server, instead, a variation of remote servers are used to host the network
                    and allow access from remote locations, it’s use is often associated with improved disaster recovery. One downside to Cloud computing is that a user must have Internet connectivity
                    in order to use it.

                    Rich Site Summary (RSS) also known as ‘Really Simple Syndication’ is content delivery method for blogs on the Internet, when content is distributed it is called an RSS feed.

                    Social Media is omnipresent in todays society and a lot of people around the world rely on it as a form of communication and marketing, having said this the forms of social
                    media available to us do not follow the exact same format when considering the content that they allow to be shared. For example, Twitter requires short, concise messages which are usually
                    posted with regards to general communication between friends or associates, whereas Youtube is one that requires planned and refined media production in the form of videos.

                <div class="scroll"><h6>Whilst using a computer, for recreational purposes or as a profession, ensuring security and protecting our devices from the dangers of being connected to the Internet poses is absolutely vital.
                    When using the Internet protecting our computers from counter attacks is of utmost importance, keeping PC’s up to date with the newest updates and security patches helps to fend off malicious attacks
                    which may have been capable of doing damage to your machine otherwise. A lot of users like to utilise IDS’s - Intruder Detection Systems along with that of a built-in Firewall, an IDS is somewhat similar
                    to a Firewall in the fact they both detect for intrusion on a network, but do it in different ways. An IDS analyses all inbound and outbound activity on a network and flags up anything that may appear
                    to be of a malicious origin or an intrusive entity, if an intrusion attempt has been made the IDS signals to the user and notifies them of suspicious activity on the network, even if the attack has
                    originated from within the network itself. When using a Firewall to protect against counter attacks, the Firewall will observe the networks status and upon discovering an abnormality attempting to
                    access the network, it will attempt to stop it - the main difference here is that the Firewall will monitor network traffic and attempt to prevent security breaches as they attempt to gain unauthorised access,
                    but using an IDS can analyse a security risk from within the network if it has already gained access or if it originated from within the network itself. Closing unused or non-essential ports on a network is also
                    crucial in the prevention of hackers and security breaches, ports that are not being used can allow for hackers to gain access and make changes to configurations or distribute content throughout the network.
                    If a network has been experiencing performance issues, abnormal decrease in network speed or connectivity, you may wish to inspect the network closely and attempt to diagnose if there is any unauthorised
                    or malicious activity present on the network that may have gone unnoticed, remaining vigilant when your network is experiencing issues is essential. To ensure utmost data security when operating a functioning
                    network in a workplace, all staff and users must be equip with the appropriate training and knowledge of the risks at hand, and of possible prevention measures that can be taken in order to relieve the system of a
                    security breach - training in these areas will allow for better maintenance of the network and in turn decrease the volumes of stress the network will have to experience due to staff being knowledgeable of Internet and data security procedures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are a multitude of measures that can be taken to prevent counter attacks to your network, but what if you have already been attacked, or one of your prevention procedures has failed? The first thing to do in any
                    case of an attack is to determine the type of attack that has been posed to the network, along with its location - this can be done in a multitude of ways but if the devices IP address is available, it can be used to
                    pinpoint the attackers location and the address can be blocked and blacklisted from the network. If the attack is indeed an internal attack and has spawned from within the network itself it is advised that all affected
                    units are immediately disconnected from the network. One form of attack which is considered to be extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of a network is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, a DDoS attack describes
                    the flooding of traffic to a network from lots of different devices, this usually occurs when a host computer has been infected with some kind of malicious virus - often a Trojan, which allows a hacker or suspect behind
                    the attack to control the traffic flow to the targeted system. The reasoning for a DDoS attack and not simply a DoS attack is that a DoS attack is essentially the same but the traffic comes from only one device, allowing
                    blocking the IP address of the computer to be an effective means in which to stop the attack at its source, in a DDoS attack as mentioned the traffic pours in from many different sources, often in the hundreds or possibly
                    thousands of PC’s in different locations are all requesting from the network, clogging it with traffic. A DDoS attack is very difficult to stop as it is extremely difficult to distinguish legitimate network traffic from
                    malicious traffic inbound to the network - in the case of a DDoS attack you must contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) immediately for further instruction and assistance. When the attack has been blocked or interrupted
                    a direct backup of all significant data should be made urgently, along with diagnostics being undertaken in the manner of finding the attacks source, type and intention to further prevent future attacks of the same description.
                    If any data was affected during the attack, lost, stolen or data altered in any way it must be noted and possibly quarantined within the system - any backups that have been made in recent times should be used to reconstruct the system if damage has been caused.
                    A routine should be in order to reinstall operating systems on affected devices, but it also seen as good practice to reinstall OS on devices which have not been affected, even if there has been no attack. Stakeholders that have significant baring to the
                    company or the relevant system that has been affected should be contacted and informed of the incident as soon as possible to allow them to make important decisions regarding their involvement or to initiate an appropriate solution to the problem.

                    What is Social Engineering? What are the risks it poses to our security, and how can we combat it in the most appropriate possible manner? Well, the term ‘social engineering’ is simply defining the act of manipulating a person or group of
                    people in order to gain access to confidential information. A ‘social engineer’ is someone who intentional attempts to deceive someone into giving up their personal information, often passwords, bank details or for access to a device or network with
                    intent to distribute malicious software - to then carry out criminal activity. Social engineering attacks can be directed in many different ways, you may be asked for information that is confidential, or only being available to certain authorised users -
                    if the person requesting this information is unknown to you, or seems to be posing as someone else, do ensure not to make any contact with them. Social engineering attacks often take the form of someone attempting to gain information about a person or a
                    business, in order to prove legitimacy when contacting others to gain access to a body of information, ensuring you keep your wits about you and deter from responding to the likes of suspicious emails known as ‘phishing’ is a good way in which to avoid
                    your information falling into the wrong hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, how exactly can we prevent social engineering? In the case of someone making a request to access information which has been made confidential and not available to the general public, they must be identified. Identifying
                    someone who aims to carry out a socially engineered attack is of utmost importance, as anyone who can be identified can be flagged and be blocked from future contact. When users of a system are dealing with unidentified requests
                    from a suspicious origin, they must always follow security procedures and be trained to be knowledgeable of criminal ongoings, along with how to identify possible attacks. If you have been contacted via telephone, persons or businesses
                    often call back the source  from a customer service line, in order to confirm the legitimacy of the call - if you are unsure about something regarding your personal information or the information that is being hosted on a network by your business,
                    do always make sure to attempt to confirm its legitimacy. In the case of someone contacting you with information specific to you, ensure to make changes to any authentication requirements such as passwords or PIN numbers to disallow any further
                    information being leaked to unauthorised persons. If you have noticed suspicious activity on your computer or network, always make thorough checks on your anti-virus software and security logs to confirm this.
                    Symmetric Encryption:
                    A type of encryption which uses a ‘key’ to alter text or messages when being sent over the Internet, this key is available to not only the sender but the recipient of a message as the message is ‘decrypted’ upon arrival at its destination.

                    Asymmetric Encryption:
                    A different manner of encryption which uses a ‘public’ key, which encrypts data before it is sent to the recipient, upon arrival it cannot be decrypted without the use of a ‘private key’ which belongs only to the person receiving the message.
                    This way, a user can encrypt a message and send it to someone else using a public key, but it cannot be decrypted unless a specific ‘private’ key is available to the recipient.

                <br>
                <div class="scroll"><h6>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the ‘original’ protocol for
                    data encryption which was developed for wireless networks, intended to provide similar
                    levels of security as wired network - although it is known to be difficult to configure
                    and have significant security issues. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) superseded WEP during
                    the development of the 802.11i wireless security standard in 2003, WPA uses both pre-shared
                    keys (PSK) and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to carry out data encryption. WPA2 is
                    based on the finalised 802.11i security standard, the use of pre-shared keys with Advanced Encryption
                    Standards (AES) is what sets WPA2 apart from WPA - a set of standards which are used in the most current iterations.
                    Authentication provides a network with a control system in which levels of access can be determined, higher levels of
                    access will be unavailable for users of a low level - whereas some access levels can simply be a user logging in.
                    Digital Certificates allow for entities on a network to be individually identified and marked as known. Encryption
                    is a security measure for the sending and receipt (transmission) of data over the Internet, it enforces confidentiality
                    as it is not readable to someone without a specific key - solely intended for a certain recipient. Encryption also enforces
                    integrity as when encrypted data packets are sent they are ‘hashed’, which means that if they are altered before they reach
                    their destination, they cannot be decrypted. Enforcement of non-repudiation with regards to encryption is carried out as the
                    encryption key corresponds directly to the person who has sent it e.g. created using the senders information. Firewalls assist
                    in monitoring computer networks in terms of inbound and outbound requests, if a Firewall locates something attempting to access
                    the network with intent to damage of the entity is unrecognised - it will throw up a flag to the user. A computer virus is a
                    program created to cause harm or carry out fraudulent activity, most viruses are capable of copying themselves and often are designed
                    to gain access to a system, hide and have detrimental effects such as corrupting files. Upon receiving emails containing unfamiliar
                    attachments or mail contents a user should ensure they do not further explore the attachment, as it could be some for of malware or
                    virus intending to corrupt your computer system, all computers should be kept up-to-date with current OS and security patches, have
                    anti-virus software and a Firewall in use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Users should always think before opening unrecognised attachments or visiting suspicious
                    webpages, use passwords which are not easily guessed or hacked and deter from using open Wi-Fi networks, scan using AV Software, confirm
                    attachments with the sender and delete suspicious emails from inbox. Patches and updates in client software are used to fix errors discovers
                    by users or the development team/developer of the software, a ‘patch’ quite literally will add certain aspects to a piece of software which
                    were previously lacking. When an attack is suspected, a user should immediately disconnect from the Internet or LAN network, use anti-virus/malware
                    software to detect malicious intrusions, remove infected files and check other devices which are connected to the network in the case of them being
                    infected also, backups of data should be made. A virus multiples itself as much as possible and attached to host files which, when moved, copied or
                    sent elsewhere, the virus will go too. A worm infects a device with no need for a host file, and can multiply and reiterate itself through a system
                    or group of systems without the need for human interaction. Spyware is software that was solely created and implemented in order to gain information
                    about someone or business, infecting a computer like a virus and lying dormant as it avoids detection, often sending information to another location
                    so that it can be collected and used by creators to carry out fraudulent or criminal activity.
